## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follow:

```
contents/   : contains ipython notebooks for instructor's demonstration purposes during training session and practice sections for participants
solutions/  : contains ipython notebooks with solutions for the practice sections
```

Class contents are structured in such a way that core functionalities of `pandas` are exposed to participants in a step-by-step and functional manner. Following contains  short description of subject covered for each scripts:

## Slide

An introductory slide deck to `pandas` is available <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RQDsvwuNiETPH3iZ6YYGzZZBOICi0ySdYHIkjxiarMo/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a>.

## Dependencies

A Google Colaboratory URL is embedded in the button beside each notebook. One click on it and you are ready to check out the contents.
If you want to access the notebooks locally, follow the steps below. 

Isolating each environment for different projects is the best practice. One of the way you can create virtual environment is by using Python's native `virtualenv` module. At this directory's root, execute the following to create a virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

Commands to activate virtual environment varies according to your OS. Use the following for Linux:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Use the following for Windows:

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

A `(venv)` appearing in front of your system path indicates that the virtual environment is successfully activated, as shown below:

`(venv) C:\Users\User\pandas-tutorial>`

Finally, execute the following to install the dependencies for this lab into your activated virtual environment:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
